# Context aware chatbot 
Chatbot for a UV detectors seller powered by LangChain, OpenAI and Streamlit.

## Overview
This code sets up a chatbot powered by OpenAI model to assist with queries related to specific documents. In this case, It utilizes a JSON file containing fictional data that describes various models of UV detectors, detailing their specifications and technical information.

It starts by setting the OpenAI API key and initializing the ChatOpenAI component. Then, it loads the data from a JSON file, processes this data by splitting it into manageable text chunks, and embeds these chunks using OpenAI embeddings. 
The embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database, which enables efficient similarity search and retrieval of relevant documents. 
A retriever is created to query this vector database, allowing the chatbot to get pertinent information based on user input, conversation history and relevant documents. 


## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, making it easy to interact with the chatbot.
- **Conversational Memory**: Maintains chat history to provide contextually relevant responses.
- **Document Retrieval**: Utilizes FAISS for efficient document retrieval based on embeddings from OpenAI.
- **Prompt Templates**: Uses `ChatPromptTemplate` to structure chatbot responses and queries.
