    "rattings": 5,
    "ingredients": [
      "2 tbsp rapeseed oil",
      "2 tbsp finely chopped ginger",
      "3 tbsp curry powder",
      "3 garlic cloves, grated",
      "2 x 400g cans chickpeas, undrained",
      "320g carrots, coarsely grated",
      "160g frozen sweetcorn",
      "1 tbsp vegetable bouillon powder",
      "4 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e",
      "250g spinach, cooked",
      "750g potatoes, peeled and cut into 3cm chunks",
      "1 tsp ground coriander",
      "10g fresh coriander, chopped",
      "150g coconut yogurt"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "To make the topping, boil the potatoes for 15-20 mins until tender then drain, reserving the water, and mash with the ground and fresh coriander and yogurt until creamy.",
      "While the potatoes are boiling, heat the oil in a large pan, add the ginger and fry briefly, tip in the curry powder and garlic, stirring quickly as you don\u2019t want it to burn, then tip in a can of chickpeas with the water from the can. Stir well, then mash in the pan to smash them up a bit, then tip in the second can of chickpeas, again with the water from the can, along with the carrots, corn, bouillon and tomato pur\u00e9e. Simmer for 5-10 mins, adding some of the potato water, if needed, to loosen.",
      "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Spoon the filling into four individual pie dishes (each about 10cm wide, 8cm deep) and top with the mash, smoothing it to seal round the edges of the dishes. If you're following our Healthy Diet Plan, bake two for 25 mins until golden, and cook half the spinach, saving the rest of the bag for another day. Cover and chill the remaining two pies to eat another day. Will keep in the fridge for four days \u2013 if following the Healthy Diet Plan pop the extra two pies in the freezer for the end of the week. If freezing, to reheat, bake from frozen for 40-45 mins until golden and piping hot."
